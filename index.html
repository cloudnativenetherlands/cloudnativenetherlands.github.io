<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>
<p>Our mission is promoting Open Source software in the Netherlands by organizing events and activities around these technologies. </p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Stichting Cloud Native Netherlands is a foundation incorporated and registered in the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KVK). Founded on 24 December 2024.  It is composed of a supervisory board and 3 board members. </p>
<p>The formation of the foundation represents the continuation of a long effort on community building that goes on since the first meetup in 2016; besides the regular monthly events and the community growing to more than 4000 members, the organization of 3 Kubernetes Community Days represents important milestones and stands for the health of the Dutch Cloud Native community.</p>
<h2 id="cncf-collab">CNCF collab</h2>
<p>We collaborate closely with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), the global organization dedicated to bringing together the worldâ€™s top developers, end users, and vendors and run the largest open source developer conferences. </p>
<p>Many of the foundation members are CNCF ambassadors or cover other roles in the Kubernetes and Cloud Native community ecosystem at large.</p>
